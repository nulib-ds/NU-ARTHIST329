This is an online guide for your Digital Mediterranean Project for ART_HIST 329: Art and Architecture of the Medieval Mediterranean World.

## What is a StoryMap? 

This assignment will teach us to use [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/overview), which is a web-based story-authoring application, to create and share your digital map of monuments and objects in the medieval Mediterranean with narrative text, images, sources, videos, audio, and other multimedia content.
