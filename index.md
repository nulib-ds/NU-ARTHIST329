Students must choose ***five (5) locations*** out of thirteen (13) to set up their GIS map. They place a monument or object at each location. Students will enter the metadata information based on their scholarly research. They must use at least two peer-reviewed references and two citations for each locationâ€™s monument or object. They can also use their class lecture notes. 

Locations include: 
> - **Constantinople**
> - **Cordoba**
> - **Outskirts of Cordoba (where Madinat al-Zahra is located)**
> - **Damascus**
> - **Eastern Jordan (where Qusayr Amra is located)**
> - **Jerusalem**
> - **Fustat (Old Cairo)**
> - **Palermo**
> - **Pisa**
> - **Mecca**
> - **Saint Catherine (Mount Sinai; Sinai Peninsula)**
> - **Venice**
> - **Toledo**

We will use **[ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/overview)**, a web-based story-authoring application, to create and share your digital map of monuments and objects in the medieval Mediterranean with narrative text, images, sources, videos, audio, and other multimedia content.
